I’m from Philadelphia and my new best friend was a New Orleans native. We both shared the same passion for food, dining, and great times! Cajun Heroes’ flavors are inspired by the Captain Bill Seafood Market in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. I chose to put my New Orleans inspired restaurant in the heart of South Street simple because I loved the neighborhood. "

I gave it a shot to see if I could learn how to do it. I did and it quickly became my passion!  Before I opened my shop, I ate at a few restaurants in the area and thought to myself that this would be the perfect location for my business. The people seemed very nice and so far I’ve been right"

In August of 1994, Dale was suddenly killed in a car accident. I spoke to his parents about continuing on with the shop. I didn't have any money, but they began renting the building to me and gave their blessings to keep the Bluebond name going. I am proud to say that over the ups and downs of the last 25 years, Bluebond Guitars is still an important part of the Philadelphia music scene. "

We anticipated opening January 2013 but received an interesting call from a couple who would become our first ever clients turned lifelong friends. They had recently adopted a pup with debilitating separation anxiety and needed a safe place for their dog to socialize while they went to work. We heard the desperation in their voices so we worked day and night to expedite our grand opening. On the weekends when barKadelphia was closed, we networked at dog parks while our pups played. We were so excited to let the community know we were open for business and made a pack from day one to never pay to advertise our services. This still remains the case today, 7.5 years later. The charm of Queen Village speaks for itself! When we began to look for space to open our doggie daycare, we knew we needed to become a part of the Headhouse District. The people are warm and the pets are plentiful. Simply put, we wouldn’t want to be anywhere else."

That’s exactly what I did! I suffered from several series injuries including multiple herniated discs and shoulder, hip and knee tears. I was in pain every single day. I tried everything but nothing worked so I decided to approach lifting weights the same way we approach modern medicine ---- by lifting in small “doses”.

My goal was to find a creative way to combine these two things together to create a unique experience for my clients. I chose the South Street Headhouse District because of how diverse and artistic the neighborhood is. I wanted to be surrounded by that art, joy and diversity. Oxymoron is a word used to describe two contradictory terms that appear in conjunction. I chose this name for my business because I believe that people can have two sides to them: the pessimistic optimist, the social introvert or the popular nerd.

While going through a temporary depression, I knew that these hands were blessed and I was going to use them to create art either way, hence the deep dive into my barber services began, even though I started cutting hair at 17 years old. The beginnings of “Sci-Fi” started July 12, 2014 when I was thrown 20 ft from my vehicle after falling asleep at the wheel. God definitely sent an angel to ensure that I was moved out of the way of a semi truck in the middle of the road. After a 4 day coma, I woke up seeing 4 of everything as a result of my brain hitting my skull 5 times! The medical team wasn’t confident that I would have a full recovery...BUT GOD! With faith and my eyes on the prize, I pressed toward the mark and cut my first head after TWO WEEKS! Fast forward to later that year, I started Another Planet in my 3rd bedroom and hustled doing odd jobs until 2016 when I got the keys to 808 South Street in a prime real estate area. Blood, sweat and tears literally walked me into a space with white walls, black hardwood floors and 6 stations. I knew I needed better but was grateful for what God provided. Through my faithfulness, I was blessed yet again to receive $40k to start the renovations on my vision. Through various media features and accolades - including but not limited to: Biz Philly, Solid Gold Magazine, Barber Evo Magazine (Philadelphia Barber Shops and World Barber Shop Interiors) PHL 17 and the major network, CBS -  I have become the Top Rated Barber in the state of Pennsylvania with over 200 5 star reviews across 3 platforms.  As a multi-award winning barber, I’ve had many opportunities to service multiple celebrities and will be adding more to my roster. Additionally, I had the opportunity earlier this year to be a part of QVC’s “All Made Up”  YoutTube series where you can gain a bit more insight into who I am. August 12th, 2020 makes 4 years of business,  so tell Another Planet, Happy Birthday! To learn more, follow me at @sci_fictional and @apbsllc.

After trying other things including teaching art in the Philadelphia Public School system, I decided to find a new career path. With the help of my partner Ann Lamon, we decided to open a music boutique specializing in Heavy Metal and its related genres on vinyl. We also sell music on other formats such as CD and cassette tape, as well as other collectible music memorabilia. I was born and raised in South Philly but have lived in various cities and states. When we decided to open a business I wanted to pay homage to my musical roots, so opening in the South Street area only seemed logical. My maternal great grandfather, Simon Mazeika, owned a tailor shop on Fabric Row in the 1920-30’s. I feel like the area has been calling me since I was born. I’m a very proud Philadelphian and through Vinyl Altar, I continue to share that pride in a positive way, both with those in the community and to all who make a pilgrimage to our place of musical worship."

I found my niche when I moved to teaching full time at a wine school. I really loved it and still do. My introduction to hospitality was when I opened a coffee shop out in Haverford called Green Engine but I always dreamt of opening up a wine bar and shop. Once the law changed in 2016 and retail was allowed to obtain liquor licensees, I began looking for a spot in Philadelphia. The Headhouse district just felt right! I love the farmers markets and I like that we’re sort of perched at the intersection of a bunch of neighborhoods with visitors from near and far. Also, my wife and I are raising our two kids here so we loved the idea of creating a business where adults and kids felt welcome and relaxed.

I left a career in engineering to go into the restaurant business and never looked back! Brauhaus is modeled after the bier houses I worked at in Köln, Germany. Over the years, we’ve brought the flavors and festivals of the Vaterland to Philly. I searched the city for a location for over a year but nothing had that old world feel I was looking for.

We called these gatherings ""Neighborhood Ramen Socials."" We made an Instagram for it and it blew up. People wanted to come to our ""restaurant"" that wasn't a restaurant, just a really hot, tiny apartment in West Philly. We then had opportunities to do pop-ups at Res Ipsa Cafe, Amis and then eventually Garage Fishtown where we really took off and made the decision to start working towards a brick and mortar ramen shop. Before opening, we traveled through Japan for a month trying all different styles of regional ramen and visiting many famous ramen chefs' shops. When we opened our brick and mortar location in January 2019 we kept the name and called our shop Neighborhood Ramen, because that's really what we want to be, your neighborhood ramen shop where you can come slurp down a soul warming bowl of noodles.  One of my best friends was a barista at Ox Coffee so we would go visit him after long days of real estate hunting and we would sit in Ox's window and joke about opening in the vacant space across the street.

One Christmas, I decided that I would make some body butter for my co-workers. I could only order supplies in bulk so after I distributed my gifts I had a bunch of body butter left over. Friends started to ask for some and then some of my co-workers ordered more. Next thing you know I had a product line!

We went to Peru to work in craft development. Afterwards, we settled in Philadelphia and opened the Eye’s Gallery, specializing in handmade items. At that time, South Street was a newly developing area full of artists. There was so much energy and possibility! I have spent much of my life as a businesswoman but I am also an artist and ceramicist. My customers are my friends and there isn’t much they don’t know about me!"

We came back with a passion to create a place where people could bring their kids during the day and their adult friends at night to have a good time! We chose South Street because it was the perfect mix of day time and night time businesses and had some great spaces with a rich history. We also love that we are next to a dense, residential neighborhood!"
